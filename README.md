# Python-Sales-Analysis-Project

First coding project I did whilst on the Code First Girls introduction to python course. This project imports a CSV called '2018 Sales and Expenditure Analysis', and then functions and formulas are coded to analyse the document.

The output calculates the total sales and expenditure for the year, whilst highlighting the highest and lowest months. Then the user is allowed to input a month they would like to gain further detail on.
